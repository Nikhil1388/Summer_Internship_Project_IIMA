This repository contains of all the R code files written by me for Fama-French Four Factor Model, Output files and the Final Project Report.

The FourFactor_Model_20211231_datatable.R file is the R code for statistical analysis and developing the Four-Factor Model upto 2021-12-31. Advanced R libraries such as
"data.table", "magrittr", "purrr", "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "openxlsx" have been employed to improve the code efficiency. The dataset contains of around (18 million rows 
* 10 columns). The working methodology of calculating the Four-Factors can be understood from the attached research paper:
